## HDFView

(If you haven't done so already...) Take the [HDFView survey](https://forms.office.com/r/anbMgVaXyF)!

The HUG25 HDF viewer roundtable provided a good overview of the relevant tools, but no real discussion developed, because we ran out of time. (Plenty of room for improvement!)

### The HDFView Anthem

I nominate one of my all-time favorite songs, [Bruce Springsteen's *Dancing in the Dark*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=129kuDCQtHs), as the anthem of HDFView.

### Key [Lyrics](https://lyrics.lyricfind.com/lyrics/bruce-springsteen-dancing-in-the-dark)

```
I check my look in the mirror
Wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face
Man, I ain't gettin' nowhere
I'm just livin' in a dump like this
There's somethin' happenin' somewhere
Baby, I just know that there is

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
```

Doesn't that aptly describe HDFView's current state?

### Next Steps

My current laundry list. Chime in!

1. Document the development set up & *Getting Started* docs.
2. Fix the installer.
3. Fix `TreeView` population.
4. Fix the dataset `GridView` population.
5. Fix copy/paste, drag & drop, etc.
6. Data import/export just works.
7. Fix HDF5 extension support, e.g., support HSDS and external filters.
8. Deprecate HDFView plugins(?)
9. `HDFView++ = HDFView + AI`
10. Facelift(?)
