Choosing keywords: #8

Don't choose keywords by which is most appropriate. Choose keywords based upon how you'd like to be reminded of that note. So by the topics you are interested in.

Example: Instead of filing an "apple" amongst "fruits", if you like to study storytelling, you might file it under "symbols of discord," as a reference to the apple's role in the stories of Adam and Eve or the Judgment of Paris.
