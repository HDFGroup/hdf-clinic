Setting and achieving goals: #3

Here is a powerful, seven-step formula that you can use to set and achieve your goals:

1. Decide what exactly you want.
2. Write it down.
3. Set a deadline for your goal; set sub-deadlines if necessary.
4. Make a list of everything you can think of that you are going to have to do to achieve your goal.
5. Organize the list into a plan.
6. Take action on your plan immediately.
7. Resolve to do something every single day that moves you toward your primary goal.
