    "# A Zettelkasten in HDF5\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to create a [Zettelkasten](https://kadavy.net/blog/posts/zettelkasten-method-slip-box-digital-example/) in HDF5. The Zettelkasten (\"slip-box\") is a method of note-taking and knowledge management that was developed, among others, by the German sociologist Niklas Luhmann. A physical Zettelkasten consists of a collection of notes, each of which is stored on a separate index card. The notes are linked together in a network of references, forming a kind of knowledge graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "How do people <i>use</i> a Zettelkasten? (rather than populating it...)\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>Depending on your research question, you start by looking for notes tagged with the relevant keywords.</li>\n",
    "<li>You open a relevant note from the list of results.</li>\n",
    "<li>You follow the links to other notes, or (less frequently) pick up new keywords along the way.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Jupyter notebook, we will create a Zettelkasten in HDF5 using the `h5py` module. Each note will be stored as a group, decorated with appropriate attributes, in an HDF5 file, and the references between notes will be stored as links between groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "A note template is shown below (see [Boltze2023a](./zettel/6.txt)):\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "TITLE OF ZETTEL: #ZETTELNUMBER\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "LINK TO AT LEAST ONE OTHER ZETTEL ON THE SAME OR A RELATED MATTER. FROM THERE, LINK BACK TO HERE.\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Zettelkasten will be stored in a file called `zettelkasten.h5`. The file will contain a group called `ZETTEL`, which will contain all the notes. Each note will be stored as a group within the `ZETTEL` group, with the name of the group being the ID (positive integer) of the note. The note groups will be decorated with a `text` attributes, which will contain the text of the note. Storing the entire note in a UTF-8 encoded string (attribute) preserves it for easy import from or export to external tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be special notes containing citations, which will be also linked to a group called `CITATIONS`. Finally, there is a group of `TAGS` that will contain all the tags used in the notes. The structure of the Zettelkasten will look like this:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The figure might look more intimidating than it is. But you need a firm grasp on HDF5 groups and links to make sense of it. You could also mimic this picture in a POSIX file system with directories, hard links, and extended attributes. (I recommend you to try it and compare it with the HDF5-based solution!)\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, let's get on with HDF5 and `h5py`!\n",
    "\n",
    "A few helpers let us read the text notes, create the notes/zettels, and create the links between them."
