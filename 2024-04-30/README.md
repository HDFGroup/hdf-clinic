# An HDF5-based Zettelkasten store: Call the Doctor with Gerd Heber 4/30/24

The Zettelkasten (“slip-box”) is a method of note-taking and knowledge management for writers that was (re-)invented many times and more recently developed by the German sociologist Niklas Luhmann. The Zettelkasten is a collection of notes stored on separate index cards. The notes are linked in a network of references, forming a knowledge graph. HDF5 has everything necessary to create a nifty (digital) Zettelkasten store. (Spoiler alert: Each note will be stored as a group in an HDF5 file, and the references between notes will be stored as links between the groups.) The only component that needs to be added is an intuitive UI, which we leave to the ingenuity of our resourceful attendees. Join us!
